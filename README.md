## User Experience <br><br>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

### User Stories + Agile Methodology

<p align="center">
   <img src="Assets/Documentation/readme-content/User-Stories/user-stories.png">
</p>

Throughout the development of my website, I applied Agile methodologies to maintain an iterative, adaptable, and user-centered workflow. I began by breaking down the project into epics - such as ‚ÄúUser Authentication & Profiles‚Äù and ‚ÄúWishlist Management‚Äù- and defining user stories within each to guide development. Using the MoSCoW prioritization method, I identified the most critical features required for launch and focused my initial sprints on those. Working in short, focused iterations allowed me to continuously test, refine, and improve the product. Regularly reviewing progress helped ensure that each sprint delivered tangible value, and I was able to pivot or optimize based on emerging needs and feedback.

By following this Agile approach, I successfully achieved a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within just three days, delivering a fully functional version of the site that included user registration, authentication, and wishlist creation. After reaching MVP, I continued to expand and enhance the project by completing additional epics, including real-time notifications, responsive design, and accessibility improvements. Each feature was implemented incrementally, tested thoroughly, and refined through iterative feedback loops. This process not only ensured continuous progress and high-quality output but also demonstrated the effectiveness of Agile principles in rapidly delivering and evolving a working product.

### Strategy

- The primary strategy was to engage users by providing a streamlined and interactive way to organize their gaming interests using wishlists. Features like wishlist creation, real-time tracking, and community insights encourage users to actively maintain and share their game collections, fostering a sense of ownership and social engagement.

### Scope

- The main goal for users on the website is to create and manage wishlists of games they want to play or purchase. Users can add games to multiple wishlists, reorder them for priority, and explore game details, making wishlisting an effective tool for game planning and discovery.

### Skeleton

<p align="center">
   <img src="Assets/Documentation/readme-content/Wireframes/Backlog_FinalWireframe.png" alt="Wireframe">
</p>

- The wireframe layout was designed to clearly separate core features such as wishlist management, profile customization, and game browsing. Key elements like the navigation bar and wishlist card grids provide intuitive access paths, while dashboard metrics give users quick insights into their and the community's engagement.

### Structural

- The structure is user-centered, aiming for ease of use and efficient navigation between wishlists and game detail pages. Grouping the main interactive elements visually supports natural workflow ‚Äî for example, placing popular wishlisted games and community charts prominently to inspire exploration and social proof.

### Surface

- The final visual design uses pastel colors and a clean, modern typographic scheme to create a welcoming and warm atmosphere. Accessibility considerations such as high contrast text and carefully assigned color roles ensure readability and usability across devices, while thoughtful spacing ensures the UI feels uncluttered yet inviting.

### Typography

      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td width="500">
      The process began by using Fontjoy, a tool that generates font combinations using deep learning to help identify which fonts pair well for different roles like headlines, subheadings, and body text. Fontjoy provided helpful suggestions, allowing for quick experimentation with various font pairings and helping inform where each font should be used‚Äîfor example, recommending certain fonts for headings and others for body copy.
      </td>
      <td width="500">
      The final screenshot displays the set of fonts chosen for the project, including Josefin Sans, Maven Pro, Alegreya Sans SC, Cairo, and Montserrat Alternates. These fonts were selected mainly because they visually complement each other and help give the site a modern and readable appearance, with each font serving a specific purpose (e.g., headings, sub-headings, buttons, body text and accents).
      </td>
   </tr>

This transparent selection process shows that design choices were informed by automated tools but ultimately guided by aesthetic judgment and usability needs as well as providing a professional look to a pastel themed website.

   <tr>
      <td width="333">
         A pastel color palette was chosen for the website because it creates a soft, playful, and inviting look that fits well with a wishlist-focused app. The main reason for picking these colors was personal preference‚Äîthey seemed visually appealing and helped set a friendly tone.
      </td>
      <td width="333">
         To ensure the pastel colors were accessible and effective, an AI tool provided guidance on assigning each color to specific roles such as error accents, button backgrounds, and highlight areas on the site. The tool also suggested adding a deep charcoal (#2c2c2c) for body text and iconography as a dark contrast anchor, helping maintain legibility and contrast throughout the user interface.
      </td>
      <td width="333">
         Accessibility tips included using strong contrast for text, ensuring buttons have readable text even against pastel backgrounds, and providing clear visual focus indicators for keyboard navigation. The final palette uses pastel tones for decorative and interactive elements, with a dark text color for clarity, balancing aesthetics with usability.

## Deployment & Setup <br><br>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

### Prerequisites

#### Software Needed for Setup & Deployment
- A [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) Account is Required to Deploy your Application.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) For Cloning and Pushing to your Github Account.
- [Python 3.13.*](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Required for coding the Website.
- [Node,js](https://nodejs.org/en) Required to install packages from package.json for Setup.
- A [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) Account to Make Profile Feature Available
- PostgreSQL Database or Database of your choice

### Deployment Steps

#### Clone Repository

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Create a Bash Terminal in VS-Code
3. Change directory to where you wish for the Repository to be located using
   ``` cd .. or cd nameoffolder/ ```
4. Once prefered location is found and set type in the terminal ``` git clone https://github.com/Rebeljoka/Capstone-Project---Backlog.git ```.
5. Once all files are created, You need to create virtual environment by doing CTRL + SHFT + P and typing ``` Python: Create Environment ``` the repo requires python 3.13 so slecect that and call the Virtual Environment ``` venv ```.
6. Once venv is created, in your terminal write ``` .venv/Scripts/Activate ```
7. once activated you should type in the terminal in the .venv
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```
8. once completed, create a file in the root directory called
   ``` Procfile ```
      (This file is case sensitive and isnt allowed a file extension) in the procfile you want to add this line
   ``` web: gunicorn config.wsgi ```
9.  Next create another file in root directory called
   ``` env.py ``` and add this block of code into the file
   ```
      import os

      os.environ.setdefault(
         'SECRET_KEY',
         (
            'INSERT DJANGO SECRET KEY HERE'
         )
      )
      os.environ.setdefault(
         'DATABASE_URL',
         (
            'INSERT DATABASE URL HERE'
         )
      )
      os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
      os.environ.setdefault('CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME', 'INSERT CLOUDINARY NAME HERE')
      os.environ.setdefault('CLOUDINARY_API_KEY', 'INSERT CLOUDINARY API KEY HERE')
      os.environ.setdefault('CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET', 'INSERT API SECRET HERE')
   ```
(this file will be used for local deployment and testing)

10. Next apply migrations in the terminal using
   ```
   py manage.py makemigrations
   py manage.py migrate
   ```
   Next in the Terminal Type in
   ```
   py manage.py create superuser
   ```
11. Next create a new terminal in vscode and change directory using ```cd```
   ```
   cd theme/static_src
   ```
   and then type in 
   ```
   npm install
   ```
once that is done
   ```
   git add .
   git Commit -m "Add: Template"
   git Push
   ```
   this will push all the files to your local repository to github.

#### Heroku Deployment

1. Login to heroku
2. Create new app
3. New -> Create new app
4. Choose a unique app name, and select a region local to you, then click create app
5. Now We Have To Configure Environment Variables
6. go into the app you just created (if youre not in it already) and click the settings tab and scroll until you find reveal config vars and add the following keys:
   ```
   DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1
   DATABASE_URL = "" provide your postgreSQL DB URL/db of your choice
   SECRET_KEY = "" a secure random string of letters, numbers and characters.
   ```
 use a [secret key generator](https://djecrety.ir/) if needed (Use the same key and paste it in your env.py)

#### Cloudinary Setup

1. Sign Up/Login to Cloudinary
2. Go to Dashboard and find a tab called Product Environment and click go to API Keys
Click Generate New API Key, Confirm your email and give the API a nice name!
3. At the top of the site, cloudinary guides you on how to format your API key, for Heroku in config vars you Call the variable CLOUDINARY_URL and the value if everything after the =.
4. after adding cloudinary to heroku you need to add the API to env.py, once that is done push again to giithub and move on to next Section.

#### Connect Heroku to Github + Repository

1. In heroku go to deployment tab
2. Connect your app to your Github Repository
3. Click Deploy Branch to deploy your project to heroku
4. Once deployed, visit the link and copy it and paste the URL into Config/Settings.py ALLOWED_HOSTS so it looks like this (Replace the last one in the ALLOWED_HOSTS '*.herokuapp.com' with your link)
5. once all of that is done and you have pasted both the secret key in env and deployment link ALLOWED_HOSTS push to github again and deploy to heroku again and you should have a working site!


#### Finish
You now have your own wishlist website!

*Results indicate that the Wishlist feature is functioning as intended across both desktop and mobile platforms but due to how cloudinary API requests images and end to end encryption, the communication between the frontend and backend is handled insecurely using http instead of https which may expose sensitive user data. I will display the results of the Lighthouse audits below. This is the final version after implementing the patch.*

      <td align="center" width="333">
         CSS Bug: Unavoidable due to the fact that Tailwind CSS is a utility-first framework, which means it provides low-level utility classes that can be combined to create custom designs. This approach can lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior when multiple classes are applied to the same element, especially if there are overlapping styles or specificity issues.
      </td>
      <td align="center" width="333">
         JavaScript Bug: Issue came from booking functionality not properly handling edge cases and not displaying correctly on the html through the DOM manipulation. Bug was resolved by rewriting the function to properly handle all edge cases and display the correct information on the html as well as tying the script to the dedicated html section
      </td>
      <td align="center" width="333">
         Tailwind Bug: Addressed by reviewing and updating Tailwind utility classes to fix styling inconsistencies and improve responsiveness. Some layout issues were resolved by adjusting class combinations and ensuring proper use of Tailwind's responsive design features.

## AI Development Assistance

### How AI Supercharged My Development Workflow

The integration of AI into my development toolkit has enhanced my productivity by providing targeted support at critical stages, allowing me to focus on creativity and problem-solving rather than repetitive tasks. Rather than replacing my expertise, AI has served as a versatile assistant that fills in gaps, accelerates routine work, and offers suggestions I can adapt and refine.

Starting with code generation and completion, AI tools helped streamline boilerplate creation and syntactic details, so I spent less time on setup and more time designing core features. When defining data models or API endpoints, AI suggestions offered quick templates I could customize, reducing the friction of initial scaffolding without dictating architectural choices.

When it came to implementing best practices, AI acted as a handy reference, flagging potential security concerns or code smells as I worked. Instead of manually double-checking every guideline, I received prompts reminding me to sanitize inputs or apply consistent naming conventions, which helped me maintain a clean, maintainable codebase without disrupting my natural workflow.

For testing and quality assurance, AI-assisted test-case generation accelerated the creation of unit and integration tests that cover edge cases I might have overlooked. The AI-generated tests served as a safety net, catching small bugs early so I could devote more time to crafting complex features and refining user interactions instead of wrangling unexpected failures late in the cycle.

AI also helped optimize my day-to-day development efficiency by automating mundane tasks‚Äîsuch as generating configuration files, formatting code, or suggesting command-line invocations‚Äîso I could stay in the zone and avoid context switching. These small time savings added up, keeping momentum high and distractions low throughout the project.

By leveraging this support judiciously, I was able to reach a functional MVP on the third day of development. The core logic, user flows, and interactive elements were crafted through hands-on coding and design, while AI handled much of the groundwork and repetitive setup tasks. This partnership let me validate features rapidly and shift quickly into user feedback and iteration.

AI-assisted automated user testing jump-started validation of the MVP‚Äôs core flows by simulating a variety of user interactions‚Äîlogging in, searching for games, and navigating key features‚Äîwithout the overhead of recruiting real participants. These AI-driven tests quickly flagged usability hiccups and functional bugs, giving me confidence that the basic experience was solid. Once the automated suite verified stability, I transitioned to manual user testing to gather nuanced feedback on UI design, accessibility, and overall satisfaction, ensuring the final product resonated with real-world users before launch.

Beyond the immediate sprint, AI also served as an on-demand learning companion. When exploring unfamiliar libraries or debugging tricky issues, I consulted AI snippets and explanations as a starting point, then adapted those insights to fit the project‚Äôs specific context. This approach reinforced my understanding without turning AI into a crutch.

In essence, AI has become a multiplier for my existing skills rather than a substitute. It tackles routine work and offers guidance, while I remain firmly in control of the vision, design decisions, and creative problem-solving that drive each project forward.
