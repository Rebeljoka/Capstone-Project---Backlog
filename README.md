      The process began by using Fontjoy, a tool that generates font combinations using deep learning to help identify which fonts pair well for different roles like headlines, subheadings, and body text. Fontjoy provided helpful suggestions, allowing for quick experimentation with various font pairings and helping inform where each font should be used—for example, recommending certain fonts for headings and others for body copy.

      <td width="500">
      The final screenshot displays the set of fonts chosen for the project, including Josefin Sans, Maven Pro, Alegreya Sans SC, Cairo, and Montserrat Alternates. These fonts were selected mainly because they visually complement each other and help give the site a modern and readable appearance, with each font serving a specific purpose (e.g., headings, sub-headings, buttons, body text and accents).

This transparent selection process shows that design choices were informed by automated tools but ultimately guided by aesthetic judgment and usability needs as well as providing a professional look to a pastel themed website.

   <tr>
      <td width="333">
         A pastel color palette was chosen for the website because it creates a soft, playful, and inviting look that fits well with a wishlist-focused app. The main reason for picking these colors was personal preference—they seemed visually appealing and helped set a friendly tone.
      </td>
      <td width="333">
         To ensure the pastel colors were accessible and effective, an AI tool provided guidance on assigning each color to specific roles such as error accents, button backgrounds, and highlight areas on the site. The tool also suggested adding a deep charcoal (#2c2c2c) for body text and iconography as a dark contrast anchor, helping maintain legibility and contrast throughout the user interface.
      </td>
      <td width="333">
         Accessibility tips included using strong contrast for text, ensuring buttons have readable text even against pastel backgrounds, and providing clear visual focus indicators for keyboard navigation. The final palette uses pastel tones for decorative and interactive elements, with a dark text color for clarity, balancing aesthetics with usability.

### Database

#### Database Schema Documentation

#### Overview
This Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) represents the database structure for a Steam game wishlist management platform. The schema is designed to handle user authentication, game catalog management, personalized wishlists, user profiles, and activity tracking.

#### **Core Entities**

#### USER

- **Primary Entity**: Represents authenticated users in the system.
- **id (Primary Key)**: References Django's built-in authentication system.
- **username**: Unique identifier for user login.
- **Relationships**: Central hub connecting to games, wishlists, profiles, and activities.

#### GAME

- **Content Entity**: Stores comprehensive game information.
- **game_id (Primary Key)**: Unique game identifier.
- **submitted_by (Foreign Key)**: Links to the user who added the game.
- **Core Fields**: title, image, descriptions, release_date, developer, age_rating, platform.
- **Purpose**: Maintains the complete catalog of Steam games available for wishlisting.

#### WISHLIST & WISHLIST_ITEM
**Core Functionality**: Implements the wishlist system through a two-table approach.

- **WISHLIST**:
  - Container for user's wishlist collections.
  - Users can create multiple named wishlists.
  - Tracks creation and modification timestamps.

- **WISHLIST_ITEM**: Individual games within wishlists.
  - **order**: Enables custom ordering of games within lists.
  - **added_on**: Tracks when each game was wishlisted.
  - **Relationship**: Many-to-many between games and wishlists.

#### **Supporting Entities**
#### Classification System

- **TAG**: Flexible labeling system for games (e.g., "Indie", "Multiplayer", "Action").
- **GENRE**: Formal genre classification (e.g., "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation").
- **PLATFORM**: Gaming platforms (Steam, Epic Games, etc.) with status tracking.

#### User Experience Enhancement

- **USER_PROFILE**:
  - Extended user information beyond basic authentication.
  - Profile customization (picture, bio).

- **FAVORITE_GENRE**: User's preferred game genres.
- **PLATFORM**: User's gaming platform preferences.

**ACTIVITY**:

- User action tracking for engagement and recommendations.
- Captures user interactions with timestamp and descriptive text.
- Icons for visual activity feed representation.

#### **Analytics**

- Daily analytics for platform monitoring.
- Distinguishes between unique and returning visitors.
- Enables growth tracking and usage pattern analysis.

#### **Key Relationships & Data Flow**

#### User-Centric Design

- USER → WISHLIST → WISHLIST_ITEM → GAME
  - Each user can create multiple wishlists, populate them with games in custom order, and manage their collections over time.

#### **Content Management**

- USER → GAME → (TAG/GENRE associations)
  - Users can contribute to the game catalog, with games being categorized through multiple classification systems.

#### **Personalization Layer**

- USER → USER_PROFILE → (FAVORITE_GENRE/PLATFORM preferences)
  - Rich user profiles enable personalized recommendations and improved user experience.

#### **Technical Implementation Notes**

#### Database Design Patterns

- **Foreign Key Relationships**: Maintain referential integrity across all entities.
- **Many-to-Many Associations**: Games can have multiple tags/genres; users can have multiple platform/genre preferences.
- **Timestamping**: Creation and modification tracking for wishlists, profiles, and activities.
- **Ordering Support**: Custom game ordering within wishlists via the order field.

#### **Scalability Considerations**

- **Separation of Concerns**: Distinct entities for different functional areas.
- **Flexible Categorization**: Multiple classification systems (tags, genres) for comprehensive game organization.
- **Activity Tracking**: Enables future features like recommendation engines and social features.
- **Analytics Ready**: Built-in traffic monitoring for platform optimization.

This schema provides a robust foundation for a comprehensive Steam game wishlist platform, supporting everything from basic wishlist functionality to advanced user personalization and platform analytics.

### Deployment Steps

#### Clone Repository

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Create a Bash Terminal in VS-Code
3. Change directory to where you wish for the Repository to be located using
   ``` cd .. or cd nameoffolder/ ```
4. Once prefered location is found and set type in the terminal ``` git clone https://github.com/Rebeljoka/Capstone-Project---Backlog.git ```.
5. Once all files are created, You need to create virtual environment by doing CTRL + SHFT + P and typing ``` Python: Create Environment ``` the repo requires python 3.13 so slecect that and call the Virtual Environment ``` venv ```.
6. Once venv is created, in your terminal write ``` .venv/Scripts/Activate ```
7. once activated you should type in the terminal in the .venv
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```
8. once completed, create a file in the root directory called
   ``` Procfile ```
      (This file is case sensitive and isnt allowed a file extension) in the procfile you want to add this line
   ``` web: gunicorn config.wsgi ```
9.  Next create another file in root directory called
   ``` env.py ``` and add this block of code into the file
   ```
      import os

      os.environ.setdefault(
         'SECRET_KEY',
         (
            'INSERT DJANGO SECRET KEY HERE'
         )
      )
      os.environ.setdefault(
         'DATABASE_URL',
         (
            'INSERT DATABASE URL HERE'
         )
      )
      os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
      os.environ.setdefault('CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME', 'INSERT CLOUDINARY NAME HERE')
      os.environ.setdefault('CLOUDINARY_API_KEY', 'INSERT CLOUDINARY API KEY HERE')
      os.environ.setdefault('CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET', 'INSERT API SECRET HERE')
   ```
(this file will be used for local deployment and testing)

10. Next apply migrations in the terminal using
   ```
   py manage.py makemigrations
   py manage.py migrate
   ```
   Next in the Terminal Type in
   ```
   py manage.py create superuser
   ```
11. Next create a new terminal in vscode and change directory using ```cd```
